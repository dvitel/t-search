''' Base utilities to work with term.
    We resort to very simple term representation in a form of tuples (LISP style):
        1. First element is operation, other elements are arguments;
        2. Empty tuple could be see as noop during interpretation, though could be useful during syntactic manipulations.
        3. Operation/leaf is usually a string; op seamntics of symbol is necessary to evaluate the symbol.
        4. Leaves also couls be domain values, e.g. plainly evaluated terms, treated as themselves.
    All additional information, term metrics, should be stored separately.

    Abstract and concrete term forms:
    1. Concrete example: f(x1, x2, x3) = (x1 + x2) * x3 + 4.21 
    2. Abstract form 1: f(x1, x2, x3) = (x1 + x2) * x3 + c, c subject of NLP optimization 
    3. Abstract form 2: f(x1, x2, x3) = (x + x) * x + c, where x, c subject of MINLP optimization
    4. Abstract form 3: f(x1, x2, x3) = (x + x) * x + x, where x is linear combination a1 * x1 + a2 * x2 + a3 * x3 + a4, subject of NLP optimization
